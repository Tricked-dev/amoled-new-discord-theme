# Discord amoled theme for the new ui update
Simply copy the styles from `theme.css` into your `quickcss`, and you're good to go. If anything breaks, check this repository again to see if I've made a commit to fix the issue. Overall, it's a decent UI updateâ€”unfortunately, Discord still hasn't provided an official AMOLED theme. I did my best to update the existing one.
